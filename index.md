### Research Focus

My work sits at the intersection of two complementary fields: 

- **Health decision science**: developing decision‑analytic and microsimulation models.  
- **Health services, outcomes, & policy research**: examining how the fragmented U.S. health system influences childhood insurance coverage, care utilization, and health outcomes.

Using microsimulation, I evaluate policy levers that could improve equity and efficiency in health‑care delivery. I have also led decision analyses, disease‑simulation projects, and experimental/quasi‑experimental evaluations across a range of health‑policy questions.

**Education:** M.S.P.H. from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health; B.A. from Tufts University.
