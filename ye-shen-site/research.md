## Research

I apply decision science, simulation modeling, and policy evaluation to topics at the intersection of primary care, oral health, and the social safety net.

### Themes
- **Insurance continuity & utilization** — longitudinal projections of coverage and service use.
- **Oral health & workforce** — delivery models and medical–dental integration.
- **Food security & nutrition** — policy impacts on access and downstream outcomes.

### Selected works
See the [Publications]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}) page for a complete list.
