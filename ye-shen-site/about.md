I'm a PhD candidate in the Harvard PhD Program in Health Policy (Decision Sciences). My work applies simulation modeling, decision-analytic, and policy evaluation methods to health policy topics intersecting the social safety net. Current areas include primary care, dental care, and medical–dental integration.

Before my doctorate, I earned an MSPH from Johns Hopkins (International Health—Human Nutrition, with a certificate in Public Health Economics). I have contributed to projects on dental workforce, eating disorders, and food security across the United States, Canada, and low‑income countries.

When I'm not modeling policy scenarios, I enjoy translating complex methods into practical tools for decision‑makers. I also enjoy hiking and am an avid birder.
